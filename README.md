# DHNLNtupleAnalysis

`DHNLNtupleAnalysis` is a framework for reading Ntuples generated by [DHNLAlgorithm](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-phys/exot/ueh/EXOT-2017-19/DHNLAlgorithm) 
that was developed for the displaced heavy neutral lepton (DHNL) analysis. For installation instructions, see the "Getting Started" section below.

**N.B. This code is  under development.**
## Getting Started

To clone the project: 

```
setupATLAS
lsetup git
git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/atlas-phys/exot/ueh/EXOT-2017-19/DHNLNtupleAnalysis.git
```

For a new commit: 

```
git add . 
git commit -m "description of my change"
git push -u origin master
```

To configure your event selection open makeHistograms.py and update the channels list to include the cuts you want to apply.


To run the code: 

```
cd python 
python makeHistograms.py 
```

Histograms will be saved in histograms.root
