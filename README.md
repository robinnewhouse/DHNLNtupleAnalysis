# DHNLNtupleAnalysis

`DHNLNtupleAnalysis` is a framework for reading ntuples generated by [DHNLAlgorithm](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-phys/exot/ueh/EXOT-2017-19/DHNLAlgorithm) 
that was developed for the displaced heavy neutral lepton (DHNL) analysis. For installation instructions, see the "Getting Started" section below.

## Getting Started

To clone the project: 

```
setupATLAS
lsetup git
git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/atlas-phys/exot/ueh/EXOT-2017-19/DHNLNtupleAnalysis.git
```

The analysis code uses the package `uproot` to load root files. For more details see [uproot documentation](https://pypi.org/project/uproot/). To setup python to include the `uproot` package on lxplus do the following: 

```
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_96c_LS/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/setup.sh
```

If you are running on a local cluster the complier version might change (i.e. gcc9 -> gcc8). Alternatively you can setup python and install the uproot package locally yourself. 

### Running makeHistograms.py

To make histograms from DHNL ntuples do the following: 
```
cd python 
python makeHistograms.py -i path_to_dHNLntuple --config ../data/config_mc_all.json
```
One root file per channel will be saved in DHNLNtupleAnalysis/output/ folder. 


If you only want to run on a single channel (e.g. uuu channel) then run: 
```
cd python 
python makeHistograms.py -i path_to_dHNLntuple --config ../data/config_mc_uuu.json
```
For this example, the code will save the file DHNLNtupleAnalysis/output/histograms_uuu.root. To see a full list of channels see this [section](#list-of-configuration-files).

For a full list of configurable options for `makeHistograms.py` see this list of [options](#list-of-makehistogramspy-options).

### Running plotHistograms.py

Once you have run makeHistograms.py edit `../data/config_plotting.json` to include a path to the histogram files you want to plot, as well as an identifying label for each file.

Then run:
```
python plotHistograms.py --config ../data/config_plotting.json
```

The plotHisotograms.py code will be user specific depending on what histograms you want to plot. Please feel free to use the plotting functions in plotting.py in your own plotting scripts. Or use the example plotHistograms.py that is provided. 

## Quick Start Guide

This ntuple analysis code is designed to output histograms for analysis selection variables in the dHNL analysis. 

The `makeHistogram.py` file is the steering code for making histograms. To run the code, a configuration file is needed that provides the analysis code with a list of selections associated to a given channel name. For a list of the supported channel names see [List of configuration files](#list-of-configuration-files).

To add a new channel, edit the corresponding config file and make a new channel that includes the cuts you wish to apply. 

For example if you edit `../data/config_mc_uuu.json` and add "my_new_channel", when you run `makeHistograms.py -i inputFile --config ../data/config_mc_uuu.json`, a new histograms file will be created called `histograms_my_new_channel.root` in the output directory. This output file will include histograms with your new cuts. 

N.B If you wish to apply a new set of cuts that are not implemented you may wish to make a new analysis class. See Toy Analysis Class in `analysis.py` as an example.

For a list of the currently implemented cuts see the Analysis class definition in `analysis.py`.

To add new histograms, add a new observable to the list in `observables.py`. Then fill the histogram in the corresponding function in `analysis.py`.

To add a new selection, make a new class in `selections.py`.


## A note about MC weighting

Event weighting for monte carlo samples is implemented in the framework. In order to properly do the weighting the mass and lifetime of the sample you are running is required to be in the name of the input string in the same format as the DAOD_RPVLL container names. If you see a warning such as:

```
"Can't determine the mass and lifetime of signal sample. MC weight will be set to 1!!"
```
this is becuase your file is not appropriately named. Either rename your ntuple file following the convention from the DAOD_RPVLL conatiner name you used to make the ntuple or make due without MC event weighting. See the list of DAOD_RPVLL samples [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/AtlasProtected/ExoticLongLivedHeavyNeutralLeptonRel21/MC16a_MC16d_MC16e_dHNL_DAOD_RPVLLonly_corr_new.txt) for naming conventions.

## Inverted Prompt Lepton Control Region
To run the analysis selection in the inverted prompt lepton control region add "CR" to the list of selections in the config file in data/.


## Quick guide to using the micro-ntuples
Micro-ntuples are saved to the output file when you run `makeHistograms.py`. Micro-ntuples are designed to store the full tree information (not just the binned histogram) for each variable. Having access to a micro-ntuple means you can quickly re-bin or plot correlations after some selections are applied. By default the micro-ntuples are saved after the DV type cut (2-muon DV, 2-electron DV or 1-electron and 1-muon DV). 

Inside of the histogram output file you will find the micro-ntuple trees in: 
- VSI/ntuples_DVtype_VSI
- VSI_Leptons/ntuples_DVtype_VSI_Leptons

To change the cut where the micro-ntuples are saved (e.g. save ntuples after the trkqual cut), you can run: 

```
python makeHistograms.py -i path_to_dHNLntuple --config ../data/config_mc_uuu.json --saveNtuples trkqual
```

Or if you want to save them after EVERY cut: 

```
python makeHistograms.py -i path_to_dHNLntuple --config ../data/config_mc_uuu.json --saveNtuples allcuts
```

N.B This "allcuts" option makes the histogram output files much larger, especially when running on data. But the feature if available if you would like to use it. 

Here is a list of cuts that you can update the code using the --saveNtuples option: 

- all 
- charge
- DVtype
- trkqual
- cosmic
- mlll
- sel


## List of configuration files

The following are the default channels that have corresponding config files in DHNLNtupleAnalysis/data: 
- uuu: Prompt muon, 2-displaced muons
- ueu: Prompt muon, 1-displaced muon & 1-displaced electron 
- uee: Prompt muon, 2-displaced electrons
- euu: Prompt electron, 2-displaced muons
- eeu: Prompt electron, 1-displaced muon & 1-displaced electron 
- eee: Prompt electron, 2-displaced electrons


## New vertex working points
New developments have been included to modify the VSI vertex configurations in the derivation step and produced SUSY15 derivation files with new vertex containers. If you are running on an nutple that was produced from a SUSY15 derivation file you may want to run over different vertex container names. The original and new container names are listed below: 
- VSI: Original VSI container that was created in the DRAW-> AOD step. This container is just copied during the AOD -> DAOD (derivation) step. 
- VSI Leptons: Original VSI Leptons container that was created in the DRAW-> AOD step. This container is just copied during the derivation step. 
- VSI_LRTR3_1p0: New WP for vertexing with all tracks. This container was created in the derivation step.
- VSI_LeptonsMod_LRTR3_1p0: New WP for vertexing with leptons only + all track attatchment. This container was created in the derivation step.


N.B An additonal container called "VSI_LeptonsLRTR3_1p0" also exisits in the dHNL ntuples made from SUSY15 DAODs, but this vertex configuration has very large backgrounds since the additional track attatchment step is not run. It is not recommended to use this vertex configuration. 

## Making Pretty Plots

Plotting functions are defined in `plotting.py`. The steering code `plotHistograms.py` defines what kinds of plots to save in the default output directory `DHNLNtupleAnalysis/output/plots/`. Running plotHistograms.py you can plot different distribtions on the same canvas and save them to the output directory.

Make sure you edit `DHNLNtupleAnalysis/data/config_plotting.json` to include the files you wish to plot.

For making cutflow plots: 

1. open `plotHistogram.py`
2. edit the function makeCutflows() following the example provided. 
3. run `plotHistograms.py` and the output will be in `DHNLNtupleAnalysis/output/Cutflows`

For comparing histograms: 
1. open `plotHistogram.py`
2. edit compare_histograms() following the examples provided.
3. run `plotHistograms.py` and the output will be in `DHNLNtupleAnalysis/output/plots/`
